**Difference:**

Waterfall and Agile are two different methodologies of project management used in software development.

### Waterfall Model:

**.** This methodology is useful when requirements are well-defined and stable, and the project team has experience in delivering similar projects.
**.** Waterfall model is considered to be a predictive approach, where requirements and processes are defined upfront, and changes are difficult to accommodate once the project is in motion.

### Agile Model:

**.** Agile is an iterative and incremental approach where the project is divided into smaller, manageable parts, called sprints or iterations.
**.** Agile is often associated with collaboration, communication, and teamwork, as the project team works closely together to deliver the product incrementally.
