### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a set of practices that combines the work of two teams: development team (Dev) and operation team (Ops). These two teams usually work separately, which is not always efficient. If they implement the DevOps strategy and start to collaborate, they can build, test and release software much faster and safer. By removing the gap between both teams, DevOps promotes a culture of shared responsibility and accountability for the delivery and performance of software applications. DevOps shorten the **software development life cycle** and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.

### What is Software Development Life Cycle?

DevOps Software Development Lifecycle is a methodology that both teams use to bring products to market more quickly and efficiently.

It consists of the following phases:

**Plan:** This phase involves defining the requirements, goals keeping in mind the application objectives that need to be deliver to customer and creating a roadmap for the project.

**Code:** In this phase, developers write code according to the requirements and objectives defined in the planning phase and can be work on same code or different versions of code. This can be done by using git. This process is called version control of the code.

**Build:** This phase involves code execution with different tools like gradle and maven. This phase also includes running automated tests.

**Test:** In this phase, testers test the code and look for any error or bugs in the code. The automated tool selenium is mostly use in this phase.

**Release:** In this phase, the code is released to production after it has been tested and verified.

**Deploy:** This phase includes setting up servers, configuring the environment, and deploying the code to production. The goal of continuous release and deployment is to release new features to customers and users as soon as possible.

**Operate:** In this phase, the application is monitored and managed in the production environment. The Operate adoption path includes two practices two practices that allow businesses to monitor how released applications are performing in production ana to receive feedback from customers.

**Monitor:** In this phase, the application is monitored for performance and issues. This includes monitoring system performance, identifying trends and patterns, and addressing issues as they arise.
