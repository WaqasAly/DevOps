# Get a Good Basic Understanding of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD); and difference between them

Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) are two software development methodologies that can help teams build better quality software by placing a strong emphasis on testing. 

TDD is a process in which developers write automated test cases before writing the actual code. The goal is to have a comprehensive set of tests that ensure the code is working as intended and can detect any errors or bugs early in the development process. 

BDD, on the other hand, is a methodology that focuses on the behavior of the system rather than the code itself. It involves collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders to define the expected behavior of the system using natural language that is easily understood by all parties. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and the final product meets the desired requirements.

The main difference between TDD and BDD is that TDD is a developer-focused methodology that primarily focuses on testing the code itself, while BDD is a team-focused methodology that emphasizes collaboration and ensuring that the system behaves as expected. 

In summary, TDD and BDD are two software development methodologies that prioritize testing to improve the quality of the final product. TDD focuses on testing the code itself, while BDD focuses on the behavior of the system and involves collaboration between developers, testers, and business stakeholders.
