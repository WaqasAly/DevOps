## What is Taylorism?

Taylorism, also known as scientific management, is a management theory developed by Frederick Winslow Taylor in the late 19th century. The theory focuses on optimizing the efficiency of work processes through the use of scientific methods, such as time and motion studies, to identify the most efficient way to perform each task. The goal of Taylorism is to increase productivity and reduce costs by standardizing work processes and reducing the variability of worker performance.

While Taylorism was initially successful in increasing productivity in manufacturing industries, it has been criticized for dehumanizing work and reducing job satisfaction. The focus on efficiency at the expense of worker autonomy and creativity has been seen as a major drawback of the theory. However, some aspects of Taylorism continue to be used in modern management practices, such as the use of performance metrics and process optimization.
