# What are Cloud Native Microservices?

Cloud native microservices are small, independent services that are designed to work together to create complex applications. They are built using cloud native technologies and are designed to be highly scalable, resilient, and flexible.

Cloud native microservices are often deployed using containerization technologies such as Docker and run on container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes. This allows them to be easily deployed, managed, and scaled across multiple servers or even across different cloud providers.

The main benefit of cloud native microservices is that they allow for greater flexibility and agility in the development and deployment of applications. Since each microservice is independent, developers can work on them in parallel and deploy updates without affecting the entire application.

Additionally, cloud native microservices enable teams to build and deploy applications more quickly, as they can focus on developing and deploying small, targeted services instead of large, monolithic applications. This allows teams to deliver new features and updates to users more rapidly and with greater reliability.

Overall, cloud native microservices are an important component of cloud native architectures, and their use is becoming increasingly common in modern software development. They enable greater flexibility, scalability, and agility in application development and deployment, which can help organizations to better meet the needs of their customers and users.
