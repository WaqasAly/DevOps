# What Exactly is MVP? (Minimum Viable Product)

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. It is the smallest version of a product that can be built and launched to achieve the main objective of the product. 

MVPs are designed to be built and released quickly, with only the most essential features included. This approach allows teams to validate their product ideas, gather feedback, and iterate on the product in a more efficient and cost-effective way. 

MVPs can be used in a variety of settings, from startups to large organizations, and in different industries. By focusing on the core features of a product and releasing it quickly, teams can learn what works and what doesn't, adjust their strategy, and build a better product in the long run. 

In summary, an MVP is a product with just enough features to be released to customers, gather feedback, and validate the product idea. It is an important approach in Agile Development and can help teams build successful products more efficiently.
