# Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud computing offers different deployment models, including:

- **Public Cloud**: Services provided by third-party providers accessible to multiple users over the internet.

- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated services for a single organization, either hosted on-premises or provided by a third-party vendor.

- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private cloud infrastructure, allowing seamless integration between on-premises systems and cloud environments.

- **Multi-Cloud**: Use of multiple cloud service providers to meet specific requirements, allowing organizations to leverage different clouds for different purposes.

These deployment models offer organizations flexibility, control, and the ability to tailor their cloud strategy based on their specific needs and preferences.
