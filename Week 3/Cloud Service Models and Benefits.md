# Cloud Service Models and Their Benefits

Cloud computing offers different service models, each with its own benefits:

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**: Provides virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines, storage, and networking. Benefits include scalability, cost savings, and flexibility in managing infrastructure.

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**: Offers a development platform with pre-configured services and tools. Benefits include faster development, reduced complexity, and simplified deployment.

- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis. Benefits include easy accessibility, reduced maintenance, and automatic updates.

These service models provide organizations with the flexibility to choose the level of control and management they require, while offering benefits such as cost savings, agility, and ease of use.
