# Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics:

- **On-Demand Self-Service**: Users can provision computing resources as needed without requiring human intervention from the service provider.

- **Broad Network Access**: Cloud services are accessible over the network via standard protocols and can be accessed by diverse devices and platforms.

- **Resource Pooling**: Computing resources are pooled together and dynamically assigned to users based on demand. Multiple users share a common pool of resources.

- **Rapid Elasticity**: Cloud resources can be rapidly scaled up or down based on demand. Users can acquire or release resources quickly to meet changing requirements.

- **Measured Service**: Cloud usage is measured and monitored, enabling users to pay for the resources they consume. This provides transparency and cost control.

- **Ubiquitous Access**: Cloud services are available from anywhere with an internet connection, enabling ubiquitous access and facilitating remote work and collaboration.

These characteristics define the fundamental nature of cloud computing, providing users with flexibility, scalability, and convenient access to computing resources.
