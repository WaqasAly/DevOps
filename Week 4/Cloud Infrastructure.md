# Cloud Infrastructure: Regions, Computing Resources, and Storage

Cloud infrastructure encompasses regions, computing resources, and storage:

- **Regions**: Cloud providers have multiple geographic regions worldwide. Each region consists of multiple data centers that are strategically located to provide redundancy, low latency, and compliance with local regulations.

- **Computing Resources**: Cloud providers offer a wide range of computing resources, including virtual machines, containers, serverless functions, and specialized hardware accelerators. These resources can be provisioned on-demand and are billed based on usage.

- **Storage**: Cloud storage options include object storage, file storage, and block storage. Object storage is ideal for storing unstructured data, file storage provides shared file systems, and block storage offers persistent block-level storage for virtual machines.

Cloud infrastructure provides organizations with the ability to deploy applications, run workloads, and store data in a flexible, scalable, and reliable manner across various geographic regions.
