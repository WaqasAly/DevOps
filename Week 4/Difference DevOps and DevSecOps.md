# Difference between DevOps and DevSecOps

## DevOps

DevOps is an approach that combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams to streamline the software delivery process. It emphasizes collaboration, automation, and continuous integration and deployment to accelerate the delivery of high-quality software. DevOps focuses on improving collaboration, efficiency, and agility between development and operations teams.

## DevSecOps

DevSecOps extends the principles of DevOps by integrating security (Sec) into the software delivery lifecycle from the start. It emphasizes the importance of security throughout the development process, rather than treating it as an afterthought. DevSecOps aims to embed security practices and considerations into the DevOps workflow to ensure secure and resilient applications.

## Key Differences

The key differences between DevOps and DevSecOps can be summarized as follows:

- **Security Integration**: DevOps primarily focuses on collaboration and automation between development and operations teams, while DevSecOps extends this collaboration to include security practices and considerations throughout the software development lifecycle.

- **Early Security Considerations**: DevSecOps emphasizes the importance of incorporating security measures from the early stages of development, ensuring security is not an afterthought but an integral part of the process.

- **Security Automation**: DevSecOps promotes the automation of security processes, such as vulnerability scanning, code analysis, and security testing, to identify and address security issues early in the development cycle.

- **Shared Responsibility**: DevSecOps recognizes that security is a shared responsibility among all stakeholders, including developers, operations, and security teams. It encourages collaboration and shared ownership of security practices.

- **Continuous Security Monitoring**: DevSecOps advocates for continuous security monitoring and feedback loops to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities and threats throughout the application's lifecycle.
