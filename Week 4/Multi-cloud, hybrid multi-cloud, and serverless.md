# Multi-Cloud, Hybrid Multi-Cloud, and Serverless

## Multi-Cloud

Multi-cloud refers to the practice of using multiple cloud service providers to meet different business requirements. It involves distributing workloads and resources across multiple cloud platforms, such as using one provider for specific applications or services and another provider for different workloads. Multi-cloud strategies offer organizations flexibility, avoid vendor lock-in, and enable leveraging the strengths of different cloud providers.

## Hybrid Multi-Cloud

Hybrid multi-cloud combines both public and private cloud environments along with on-premises infrastructure. It allows organizations to integrate their on-premises systems with multiple public cloud providers, creating a hybrid IT infrastructure. This approach offers the benefits of public cloud scalability and flexibility while maintaining control over sensitive data and applications within a private cloud or on-premises environment.

## Serverless

Serverless computing is a cloud computing execution model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation of computing resources. With serverless, developers focus solely on writing code without worrying about server provisioning, scaling, or maintenance. The cloud provider automatically allocates resources to run the code in response to events or triggers. This model offers benefits such as cost efficiency, automatic scalability, reduced operational overhead, and rapid development and deployment.
